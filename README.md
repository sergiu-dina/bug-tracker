# Bug Tracker

This application is a bug tracking system that lets you keep track of software bugs in development projects. The software allows for users to submit tickets and those tickets are tracked through status from Open to Complete.

The app was built with ASP.NET Core, MVC, C# and SQL. The front end was developed with HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap. The database was built with SQL Server and hosted on Azure.

When you check out the app, in the Login page I recommend choosing the option to Login as a Demo Admin in order to have access to all the features of the app.

Please visit the site and try it out: https://bugtracker-dinasergiu.azurewebsites.net

## Demo Accounts

A role based security system was implemented to create permission based roles. The roles of Admin, Project Manager, Developer and Submitter restrict what the user can see and do.

If you want to check out the different roles, here are some demo accounts:

Admin: Email: admin@demo.com Password: admin1 

Project Manager: Email: manager@demo.com Password: manager1

Developer: Email: developer@demo.com Password: developer1

Submitter: Email: submitter@demo.com Password: submitter1
